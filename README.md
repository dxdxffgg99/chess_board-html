# My Chessboard 🧩

Just a chessboard I built for fun.  
No logic, no AI, no point — just pretty squares 😎

## 🔧 How to Use
Open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html` — the chessboard inner stylesheet
- No JS yet. Maybe never.

## 🤡 Why?
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ boredom.

Made with 💻 and ✨ pure chaos ✨ and also no license



### Best thing about it? No copyright. Go wild. But let's be real… no one's gonna use this
### Who in their right mind would spend time on this? Definitely not me. Oh wait...
